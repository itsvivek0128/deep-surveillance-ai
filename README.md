# 🔍 Deep Surveillance: A Real-Time AI System for Abnormal Activity Detection and Emergency Alerting

This project is an AI-powered real-time surveillance system designed to detect abnormal activities such as violence, accidents, and fire, and immediately alert relevant emergency services using Twilio SMS and live dashboard monitoring.

---

## 🚨 Features

- 🎯 Real-time **Object Detection** and **Abnormal Activity Classification** using YOLOv8
- 🛎️ Local **audio alerts** (siren) for high-confidence detections
- 📩 **SMS notifications** to:
  - 🚒 Fire Department for fire-related activities
  - 🚓 Police for crimes like burglary, fighting, or violence
  - 🚑 Ambulance for accidents and medical emergencies
- 🌐 Live **Flask Dashboard** with real-time video feed
- 🗃️ Activity log (in-memory) for the last 10 alerts
- ✅ Configurable **confidence threshold** to reduce false alarms
- 📍 Tagged **location** in alerts using environment variables
